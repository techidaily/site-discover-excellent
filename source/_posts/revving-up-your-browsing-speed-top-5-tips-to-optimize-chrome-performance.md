## Revving up Your Browsing Speed: Top 5 Tips to Optimize Chrome Performance

Google Chrome is one of the most popular browsers around. While it is notorious for being a memory hog, latest updates and Windows 10’s efficient system increases its efficiency. However, even with proper memory management and sizeable computing power, Chrome may be slow to start or may take a while to load the first page.

## 1\. Remove Unnecessary Extensions

Google Chrome was created to be a modular platform for additional functionality. Extensions and plugins can enhance the browsing experience. However, these tiny programs take up CPU power and memory. They also run alongside the browser even when not actively used. Consequently, running too many extensions and plugins will decrease the performance of Google Chrome.

Thus, one of the first things you can do is to check if any of your extensions and plugins are causing any performance issue. Access the **Extensions** page by clicking the triple-dot menu on the upper right corner. Choose **More tools**, then click **Extensions**.

![google chrome menu](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/1-2.png)

Alternatively, you can open a tab and type **chrome://extensions**. Hit enter. You should have a list of plugins and extensions in your browser. One by one, disable the extensions by clicking the toggle to off position. It is a good idea to disable most, if not all, of the extensions. Then, check if there are any improvements in the performance of Google Chrome. If so, extensions are causing the slow start or loading of web pages. Click **Remove** to delete any unnecessary extensions.

![extensions](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/2-2.png)

You should keep the extensions to a minimum. In many cases, it is better to install a full software than use a browser extension for similar functions.

## 2\. Enable the Prefetch Resources Option

For issues in loading individual web pages, you can enable Google Chrome’s Prefetch Resources Option. This technology analyzes the links on the current page that you are visiting. Then, it looks up the relevant IP addresses which the browser uses to cache the resources from those addresses. By preloading pages that you might visit, it will reduce loading time once you are redirecting to those pages.

Click the triple-dot menu on the upper right corner, then choose **Settings**.

![settings menu](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/3-2.png)

Alternatively, you can type **chrome://settings** on a new tab then hit enter. In the **Settings** window, scroll down then click **Advanced**.

![advanced settings](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/4-2.png)

Look for the **Privacy and security** section. Turn on the toggle for **Preload pages for faster browsing and searching**. In older versions of Google Chrome, you need to put a check on **Use a prediction service to load pages more quickly**.

![preload pages for faster browsing and searching](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/5-2.png)

There are two downsides to this method. First, you are downloading resources from web pages that you may not even visit. For those with limited bandwidth and system resources, this can slow down the performance further. Moreover, Google Chrome uses cookies when caching resources for the pages, which raises significant privacy issues.

## 3\. Open Chrome’s Task Manager

You do not have to go in blind and guess which extensions and plugins eat a large chunk of memory. Moreover, tabs, offline extensions, and more can be memory hogs. You can determine which processes take up a majority of memory space through Google Chrome’s own task manager.

[Why HTTPS doesn't mean Secure Site?](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)

To open your browser’s Task Manager, right-click on the space on top of the browser window. Select **Task Manager**. You can also launch the Task Manager by hitting **Shift+Esc** on your keyboard.

![task manager](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/8-2.png)

On the Task Manager window, click **Memory footprint** to sort the processes from the most demanding to the memory to the least. You will quickly see the processes that cause significant speed issues in the browser. Once you are able to identify the responsible processes, click on it. Then, hit **End process**.

## 4\. Reset Browser to Default

Sometimes it is much easier to start from scratch than trying to find the culprit hiding the in browser. Luckily, it is quite easy to reset Google Chrome to default. Head over to **Settings** through the triple-dot menu. Scroll down at the bottom, then click **Advanced**.

Under **Reset and clean up** section, click **Restore settings to their original defaults**.

Note that doing this will change several settings into default on ALL devices where you are signed in. Default search engine, new tab page, homepage, tabs, pinned tabs, cookies, site data, content settings, themes, and extensions will be affected. So, make sure that you have relevant work saved.

## Final Thoughts

Keeping a blazing fast browser requires regular upkeep, just like any type of technology. Aside from the steps described above, you should also keep Google Chrome updated along with your operating system. Moreover, older machines are known to have issues, especially with newer versions of Chrome. Maintaining a healthy browsing habit will also protect you from any malicious applications that will further decrease the performance of your browser and the rest of your computer.
