## How Viruses Can Slow Down Your Wi-Fi?

There are a few different ways in which viruses can slow down your WiFi connection.

### By Consuming Resources

One of the most common ways is by causing your computer to use up more of its resources. This can happen if the virus is running in the background, or if it is constantly opening and closing files on your computer. When this happens, your computer has to work harder, which can slow down your WiFi connection.

### By Infecting the Router

Another way that viruses can slow down your WiFi connection is by infecting the router itself. If the router is infected with a virus, it can cause the router to malfunction, which can lead to a slower WiFi connection.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### By using Internet Bandwidth

Another way that viruses can slow down your WiFi connection is by using up all of the internet bandwidth. This can happen if the virus is constantly downloading or uploading files, or if it is streaming video or audio. When this happens, there is less bandwidth available for other devices on the network, which can lead to a slower WiFi connection.

### By Causing Interference

Another way that viruses can slow down your WiFi connection is by causing interference. This can happen if the virus is emitting a signal that interferes with the WiFi signal. This can lead to a slower WiFi connection.

## How to Protect Yourself From Viruses?

### Interference

If there is interference, it can lead to a slower WiFi connection. This is because the signal can be blocked or weakened by other signals.
